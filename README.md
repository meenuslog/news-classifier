# News Classification

This project performs news article classification on the News dataset using multiple approaches including classical machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and a feedforward neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Dataset

The News Classification Dataset contains news articles with labels: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech.

## Features

- Data preprocessing with NLTK (stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Use of pretrained GloVe embeddings for text representation
- Training and evaluation of Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers
- Building and training a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Visualization of top words and word clouds for each category

## Requirements

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk wordcloud tensorflow
```
